Information responses:

100 Continue
This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.


101 Switching Protocols
This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.


102 Processing 
This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.


103 Early Hints Experimental
This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response.


Successful responses:

200 OK
The request succeeded. The result meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method:

--GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
--HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
--PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
--TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.


201 Created
The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.


202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.


203 Non-Authoritative Information
This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the 200 OK response is preferred to this status.
